### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to learn how to make a program to guess the correct number for a game. I was able to write functions that calculates how to guess a secret number between two players.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was also a favorite because I was able to learn how to use vectors for the first time to create a sandwich order. I was able to write a program that contains a pattern that reads the components of a sandwich from command-line arguments. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was another favorite because I was able to create an image for the first time. I was able to write functions that recreates the pattern displayed by combining loops such as while loops and do-while loops.
